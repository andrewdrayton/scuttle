# Scuttle

Scuttle is a job search command. When this skill is triggered:

1. Load the job-search skill: `skill_view('job-search')`
2. Read the three memory files directly (no recall tool), using the path configured in `scuttle.memory_path`:
   - `{scuttle.memory_path}/job-search-profile.md`
   - `{scuttle.memory_path}/job-search-patterns.md`
   - `{scuttle.memory_path}/job-search-sources.md`
3. Follow the "scuttle" command instructions in the job-search skill exactly
4. Deliver the report

Do not search the web. Do not define the word. Do not ask what the user means. Execute.
